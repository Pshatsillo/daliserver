1. About

DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) is bus-based lamp control sytem,
standardized by the DALI working group (DALI-AG), a subsidiary of the German
ZVEI (Zentralverband Elektrotechnik- und Elektronikindustrie e.V.).
It allows a wide range of lighting control applications, such as switching
lamps in groups, automatic leveling in response to daylight intensity,
integration into home-automation system.

daliserver is a command multiplexing server for the Tridonic DALI USB adapter,
allowing access to a DALI bus from any USB-equipped computer running a POSIX
and libusb compatible operating system.

2. Quickstart
-------------

If you got daliserver in binary form, you can skip the next section and go
straight to "Running daliserver".

To compile daliserver, you need GNU make, a C99 compliant C compiler,
libusb 1.x, libpthread, and associated development packages.
For Debian, this is roughly: build-essential, libusb-1.0-0, libusb-1.0-0-dev

The accompanying Makefile is designed for use with gcc, but any other suitable
can be used by changing the lines starting with "CC =" and "LD =".
If you need special options for pthread support or different C flags or library
paths for libusb, change the "CFGLAGS =" and "LIBS =" lines.
On Microsoft Windows, you might need to add a .exe extension to the daliserver
target, or it won't be executable.

Then, just type
make

This should produce the daliserver binary.

Running daliserver:
It doesn't accept any command line options, just run it from a terminal to see
its debugging output. If you want more verbose debug messages, uncomment the
corresponding line in the Makefile.

usbdali.pm is a Perl module that can handle construction of DALI messages and
communication with the daliserver. Some examples are provided:
alloff.pl - Sends a turn off broadcast message
allon.pl - Sends a turn on broadcast message, but no light level (lamps might
still be at 0 after sending this)
allset.pl - Sends a lamp level broadcast message
lampoff.pl - Sends a turn off command to a specific lamp
lampset.pl - Sends a level to a specific lamp

3. Communication protocol
-------------------------

To communicate with daliserver, you need to connect to it first.
It listens on localhost (IPv4 only) on TCP port 55825 (0xDA11).

The protocol is simple, only two bytes are required: the bus address and the
command code. Note however that DALI uses a specific encoding scheme, the
address field is used for other purposes.

When not issuing commands, you can listen for messages from other devices
captured on the bus. These message will come in the form:
  address:uint8_t
  command:uint8_t

To enque a command to be transmitted on the bus, just send this:
  address:uint8_t
  command:uint8_t

A response containing the status code from the target device will be sent back:
  status:uint8_t
  0:uint8_t

There is no other padding, all messages have a fixed size of 2 bytes.

eDALI commands aren't supported for now.
